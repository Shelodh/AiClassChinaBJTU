## Overview
Welcome to the AI Model Playground — a modular and scalable environment for experimenting with state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning architectures. This repository is designed to support both learning and rapid prototyping in the field of artificial intelligence.

## Features
- Custom implementations of popular models:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)
  - Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)
  - BERT-inspired NLP modules
  - Additional hybrid and experimental designs
- Clean project structure for easy navigation
- Quick setup for immediate use
- Jupyter notebook integration for fast experimentation
